
Prompt 1:
    Purpose: debugging
    several small prompts were used to identify coding logic bugs
    Code was pasted and the AI identified logic errors which I then fixed manually
    verification: incremental development and printing results as with normal debugging

Prompt 2:
    Purpose: API lookup
    several small prompts were used to look up python apis and of the form "how do I do xyz"
    Code was occasionally pasted into the prompt for context
    Accepted changes were manually typed in by following patterns
    verification: incremental development and printing results as with normal debugging

Prompt 3:

    Purpose: Choose apis

    <pasted entire solver code>

    I will need to run this in a web app. I will need a gui library that can support inputs of all the parameters with a gui (both on a canvas and in spreadsheet form), support unit conversion, and support display of the deformed structure with dynamic exaggeration.

    I need you to choose a GUI library and form a design for using this code in a web app.

    Ideally, the interactive gui is controlled by python, and is portable in the web app or in pure python.

    Response:

                GUI library choice

                Use HoloViz Panel (widgets + layout) with Bokeh (2D “canvas” plotting) and Tabulator (spreadsheet-style editable tables). This gives you:

                Canvas + spreadsheet inputs: Bokeh plot for geometry/visualization; Panel Tabulator for editable node/element/material tables.

                Python-controlled interactivity in a web-compiled package: Panel supports running fully in-browser via Pyodide/PyScript and can render components into the DOM with .servable().

                ... more ...

                I accepted the suggestion to use HoloViz panel.
                
Prompt 4:
    Purpose: Plan GUI
    Prompt:
                I want to keep the stiffness matrix code AS-IS in its current form, and call it as a lib in the GUI app. It should just use the TrussModel2D to use the api from a gui file.

    Response:

                Understood. Keep all solver/stiffness code unchanged and treat it as an imported library. The GUI app becomes a thin layer that only populates a TrussModel2D instance and calls run_analysis().

                Below is a design that does that cleanly.

                1) Package layout

                Put your existing file in a module and do not modify it.

                truss_solver/
                __init__.py
                truss2d_solver.py     # your full code, AS-IS
                gui_app/
                app.py                # Panel GUI (imports solver)
                model_bridge.py       # DF/GUI state -> TrussModel2D calls
                units.py              # optional: conversion helpers

                Key requirement: your solver file must be importable without running main().

                ... more .. 
    Accepted: Some File Layout Suggestions

Prompt 5:
    Prompt:

                make the GUI have a separate file for input and for output, this keeps the results code separate for easy inspection.

                Have an app.py that is the main skeleton and GUI state, have a file for each input tab,  and have a file for the output tab.

                The output tab will show all inputs and outputs in table form and the GUI image with an exaggeration slider.
